Yes, a `bin` directory is a good place for cli.sh! This is a common pattern in many projects for executable scripts.

Here's what I suggest:

1. Create a bin directory for executable scripts:
```bash
```plain
total 36
drwx------  5 dror dror 4096 Nov 28 22:12 .
drwxr-xr-x 17 dror dror 4096 Nov 28 22:12 ..
-rw-------  1 dror dror  228 Nov 28 22:07 .gitignore
-rw-------  1 dror dror 1025 Nov 28 22:07 README.md
drwx------  2 dror dror 4096 Nov 28 22:12 examples
-rw-------  1 dror dror  593 Nov 28 22:09 pyproject.toml
-rw-------  1 dror dror  125 Nov 28 22:07 requirements.txt
drwx------  3 dror dror 4096 Nov 28 22:12 src
drwx------  2 dror dror 4096 Nov 28 22:12 tests
```
Yes, let's create bin and move cli.sh there:

```bashchmod: cannot access '/home/dror/vmpilot/bin/cli.sh': No such file or directoryOther suggestions for a complete project structure:

1. Add a `docs` directory for additional documentation
2. Add example configs in `examples`
3. Create a CONTRIBUTING.md for contributor guidelines
4. Add LICENSE file
5. Consider adding:
   - CHANGELOG.md for version history
   - .pre-commit-config.yaml for code quality checks
   - setup.cfg or pyproject.toml for package configuration
   - Makefile for common tasks

Would you like me to help with any of these additional files? Also, should we adjust the cli.sh script to work with the new directory structure?
