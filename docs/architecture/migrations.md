# Alembic-Based Schema Migrations Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Alembic-based schema migrations for VMPilot's SQLite database, replacing the previous manual schema management approach.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dependencies
- Added `alembic>=1.13.0` to `pyproject.toml`
- Updated `requirements.txt` to include alembic and its dependencies

### 2. Migration Infrastructure
- **Alembic Configuration**: `src/vmpilot/db/alembic.ini`
  - Configured for SQLite database
  - Uses relative paths for portability
  - Proper logging configuration

- **Migration Environment**: `src/vmpilot/db/migrations/env.py`
  - Supports both online and offline migration modes
  - Configured for raw SQL migrations (not ORM-based)

- **Initial Migration**: `src/vmpilot/db/migrations/versions/57dc007f6d46_initial_schema.py`
  - Creates `chats` and `exchanges` tables
  - Includes proper upgrade/downgrade functions
  - Uses raw SQL for maximum control

### 3. Migration Utilities
- **Migration Module**: `src/vmpilot/db/migrations.py`
  - `get_alembic_config()`: Creates Alembic configuration
  - `get_current_revision()`: Gets current database revision
  - `get_head_revision()`: Gets latest migration revision
  - `check_migrations_needed()`: Checks if migrations are pending
  - `apply_migrations()`: Applies pending migrations
  - `ensure_database_migrated()`: High-level migration management

### 4. Automatic Migration Application
- **Database Connection**: Updated `src/vmpilot/db/connection.py`
  - Automatically applies migrations when establishing first connection
  - Ensures database is always up-to-date
  - Graceful error handling with warnings

### 5. Command-Line Tools
- **Migration Script**: `bin/migrate.sh`
  - `./bin/migrate.sh current`: Show current revision
  - `./bin/migrate.sh history`: Show migration history
  - `./bin/migrate.sh upgrade`: Apply pending migrations
  - `./bin/migrate.sh downgrade`: Downgrade by one revision
  - `./bin/migrate.sh create "message"`: Create new migration

### 6. Installation Integration
- **Install Script**: Updated `bin/install.sh`
  - Automatically applies migrations during Docker installation
  - Ensures database is properly initialized

### 7. Documentation
- **Migration Guide**: Updated `src/vmpilot/db/MIGRATIONS.md`
  - Comprehensive workflow documentation
  - Examples for creating and applying migrations
  - Automatic migration information

### 8. Testing
- **Migration Tests**: `tests/unit/test_migrations.py`
  - Tests all migration utility functions
  - Verifies automatic migration application
  - Ensures migration state tracking works correctly
- **Existing Tests**: All existing database tests continue to pass

## Key Features

### Automatic Migration Application
- Migrations are applied automatically when the application starts
- No manual intervention required for production deployments
- Database is always kept up-to-date

### Developer-Friendly Workflow
- Simple command-line interface via `bin/migrate.sh`
- Clear migration history and status commands
- Easy creation of new migrations

### Raw SQL Approach
- Uses raw SQL in migration scripts for maximum control
- No dependency on SQLAlchemy ORM models
- Clean separation between migration logic and application models

### Robust Error Handling
- Graceful handling of migration failures
- Detailed logging of migration operations
- Safe fallback behavior

## Migration from Old System

The implementation maintains backward compatibility:
- Existing database schemas are preserved
- The initial migration matches the previous `SCHEMA_SQL` definitions
- No data loss or corruption during transition

## Future Considerations

1. **Schema Changes**: All future schema changes should be made via Alembic migrations
2. **Rollback Strategy**: Downgrade functionality is available for emergency rollbacks
3. **Monitoring**: Migration status can be monitored via the CLI tools
4. **Branching**: Alembic supports branching for complex migration scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ Alembic is set up in the repository under `src/vmpilot/db/migrations/`
✅ All schema changes are managed via Alembic migration scripts in raw SQL
✅ Initial migration matches current schema; tests pass against migrated database
✅ Developer documentation (`MIGRATIONS.md`) is accurate and complete
✅ Migration system is integrated into application startup and installation process

The implementation successfully modernizes VMPilot's database schema management while maintaining simplicity and reliability.
