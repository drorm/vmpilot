# Create a separate key for VMPilot

When you first start using the llm you may want to limit the cost. You can do this by creating a separate key for VMPilot. This way you can set a budget for VMPilot and not worry about the cost of other keys.

# Use workspaces in WebUI

Workspaces are very powerful since they allow you to group pipelines and prompt. Examples of workspaces:
- My software with OpenAI
- My software with Anthropic
- Frontend development
- Backend development
- Personal

In the workspace prompt tell the llm:
- The root directory of your project. This is crucial so it knows where to find the files you are working on.
- The stack you're using
- A description of the project and the hierarchy of the files

## Create a workspace
- Click on "Workspace"
- Click on "+" to create a new workspace
- Name it, enter a prompt and edit any other settings
- Click "Save"

# Limit the size of the chat

After a while, the chat can become very long, and the llm's response become less useful. When that happens, just start a new chat with the same or updated prompt.


# Working with the llm

Sometimes llms are like toddlers: "Wow look at how much they can do!" and sometimes they are like teenagers: "How can someone so smart be so dumb?" 

Here are some tips to get the most out of the llm:

- Read about prompt engineering. It's a skill that takes time to develop but it's worth it.
- Don't ask the llm to do too much at once. Break down the task into smaller tasks.
- Sometimes, you just need to do the task yourself, at least part of it.
