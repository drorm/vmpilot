- VMPilot has 3 tools available to it. 
    - A create file tool to create files: used above to create the Python file.
    - A shell tool to run bash commands: used to make it executable.
    - An edit file tool to edit files: used below to change the code.
- When it uses a tool, you see the command or the result in bold.
- The output of the shell tool is fenced in a code block and is truncated to 10 lines (configurable). 
- We can't see the full output of the command, so it gives us an opportunity to ask the llm to change the code.
