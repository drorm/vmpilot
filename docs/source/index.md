# Welcome to VMPilot

[TOC]

VMPilot is a chat-based AI development agent that operates directly in your virtual machine environment. It combines natural language understanding with the ability to perform complex development tasks - reading and modifying code, managing GitHub issues, and executing system commands. Powered by OpenWebUI's rich chat interface, it provides an intuitive way to interact with your development environment through workspaces, advanced chat features, and support for multiple AI models.

> [!CAUTION]
> Only run this if you have enough knowledge about the security implications of running arbitrary commands in your virtual machine.
> **Never run this directly on your personal machine**. You are letting the AI/LLM pilot run commands in your machine and it can be dangerous.
