VMPilot is:
- your pair programming partner
- virtual machine based: it reads, writes, and performs various actions on files and run commands in the virtual machine.
- an agent. It runs multiple commands to perform a task. Itâ€™ll for instance run a unit test, see an error, fix it, and keep making changes until there are no errors.
- web based with a very advanced and powerful UI curtsy of OpenWebUI.
- extensible. Using plugins it targets the full life cycle of software development: creating issues, coding, testing, documenting, etc.

> [!CAUTION]
Only run this if you have enough knowledge about the security implications of running arbitrary commands in your virtual machine.
**Never run this directly on your personal machine**. You are letting the AI/LLM pilot run commands in your machine and it can be dangerous. Additionally, there is a risk that the AI might interact with the external world, and be taken over by an attacker.
