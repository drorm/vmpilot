Follow this sequence:
1. **Investigate**: Collect necessary information (e.g., from files or system state) to understand the task.
2. **Plan**: Present a clear plan to the user, including what you intend to change or create.
3. **Get approval**: Wait for **explicit** approval from the user.
3. **Implement**: Only proceed with actions (e.g., file edits or shell commands) *after* the user confirms the plan.
