# VMPilot Reports Directory

This directory contains automatically generated reports from various quality and testing tools.

## Contents

When running quality checks, the following reports may be generated here:

- **Type Checking (mypy)**
  - `mypy-report.txt` - Human-readable type checking output

- **Test Coverage**
  - `coverage.txt` - Text summary of coverage results

## Usage

These reports are generated by scripts in `tests/`:
- `type_check.sh` - Runs mypy and generates type checking reports
- `coverage.sh` - Runs test coverage analysis and generates coverage reports

You can also run these checks as part of the feature merge process using:
```bash
sh/featureMergeToDev.sh <branch-name>
```

## Notes

- All report files (except this README) are gitignored
- Reports are generated on-demand and may be overwritten by subsequent runs
