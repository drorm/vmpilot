# Additional test ideas to implement once git_track.py is available:
# 1. Test handling of commit message generation
# 2. Test handling of code change summaries
# 3. Test integration with git diff parsing
# 4. Test error handling for git operations
# 5. Test proper prompt formatting for git-related tasks
